## Kaggle Tweet Sentiment Extraction Competition

Competiton : Tweet Sentiment Extraction
Predict : Support phrases from given tweet text
Evaluation : Jaccard Score


#### Objective
Sentiment analysis is a common use case of NLP where the idea is to classify the tweet as positive, negative or neutral depending upon the text in the tweet. This problem goes a way ahead and expects us to also determine the words in the tweet which decide the polarity of the tweet.

#### Evaluation Metric
Jaccard Score is a measure of how similar/dissimilar two sets are. The higher the score, the more similar the two strings. The idea is to find the number of common tokens and divide it by the total number of unique tokens.
